## Usage

### Basic Operations
1. Select a cipher tool from the navigation tabs
2. Enter your text in the input field
3. Configure any required parameters (keys, shifts, etc.)
4. Click the process button to encrypt/decrypt
5. Copy the result using the copy button

### Steganography
1. Select the Steganography tool
2. Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, etc.)
3. Enter your secret text
4. Click "Hide Text" to embed the message
5. Download the processed image
6. To extract: upload the processed image and click "Extract Text"

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is designed for educational purposes and hobby projects. While the implementations are mathematically correct, they should not be used for securing sensitive data in production environments.

### Recommendations for Secure Communication:
- Use established cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium)
- Implement proper key management
- Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Consider forward secrecy and key rotation

## Educational Value

Each tool includes:
- **Algorithm explanations** - Learn how each cipher works
- **Historical context** - Understand the origins and use cases
- **Debug information** - See step-by-step processing
- **Best practices** - Security considerations and limitations
